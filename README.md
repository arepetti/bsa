# Biological Signals Acquisition Framework

This framework aims to provide a generic reference C# implementation for biological signals data acquisition, processing, analysis and visualization.

Multiple partial implementations exist (especially in C++) but an Open Source implementation, shareable between Academia and Industry will easy interoperability and provide a robust foundation for professionals, developers and researchers. Each one will focus on her specific target and expertise but with benefits from all the others, effectively reducing time-to-market, interoperability and research costs.

This project just started and a lot must be done before an initial release will be available, at least these main areas need contributors and external help:

* Integration with existing hardware.
* Integration with Health platforms (where applicable), for example Microsoft Health.
* Definition of _standard_ interfaces between components to mitigate integration issues.
* Search and analysis of widely-used algorithms and features that should be implemented (please use Issues to suggest any enhancement and to discuss it with the community.)
* Implementation of basic components and algorithms.
* Code review and testing.
* Documentation (this is a extremely important for any Open Source framework) and translations.
